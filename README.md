# Star Wars: The Memory Game
#### The objective of this project is to create an interactive website than responds to a user's inputs.  This website features a matching game that will test the user's memory in a fun and engaging manner.  
## UX
#### This project is aimed at users of all ages who wish to test and improve their memory.  The game's theme is Star Wars, and the background picture was employed to add to the immersion. 
#### As a user I want the cards to be placed randomly so the experience is different each time.
#### As a user I want the number of clicks displayed so I know I am improving my memory.
#### As a user I want a reset button so I can quickly replay the game.
## Features
#### Header - Features the title of the game.
#### Background - Features a picture that makes the game feel more immersive, more "Star Wars."
#### Overlay - Informs the user how to play the game, it disappears when the user clicks anywhere on the screen.
#### Flip Counter - Records the amount of clicks needed to complete the game. 
#### Reset Button - Allows the user to reset the game.
#### Game Board - Features the cards which are to be flipped and matched.
#### Cards - The pieces of the game that are clicked (flipped) to check if two cards match, if not the cards will unlfip to their original state.
#### Card Shuffle - The cards are shuffled whenever the game is loaded or reset, allowing more playability for the user.
## Features left to implement
#### A countdown timer and game over conditions.
#### Different difficulties that would give the user 90 seconds for easy, 60 seconds for normal, and 30 seconds for hard.
#### Alerts to tell the user if they had won or lost the game once the timer is present.
#### Adding the ability for two users to play this game, where they would alternate flipping a pair of cards to find a match.
#### Adding a highscore that shows the least amount of clicks needed to complete the game for each individual user.
## Technologies Used
#### HTML5 - HTML5 was used to create the content on the pages.
#### CSS3 - CSS3 was used to style the cards, the overlay.
#### JavaScript - JavaScript was used to create scripts to make the cards flip, the flip counter.
#### W3C Validator - was used to validate the HTML file. https://validator.w3.org/
#### W3C CSS Validator - was used to validate the CSS file. https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/
#### Esprima Validator - was used to validate the JavaScript file. https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html
## Testing
#### Opening a port via Gitpod allowed me to have a running version of my project.  This was critical to the project as it allowed me to quickly see how my CSS and JS changes were affecting the project.
#### Validators were employed to test HTML, CSS and JS code.
#### Family members were kindly asked to test the completed project; all users could flip and match the cards, reset the game, and read how many flips they needed to complete the game. 
#### Cards were also tested extensivley to see if they would stay flipped if there was a match, and if the cards would reset if there was not a match.
## Deployment
#### GitHub was used as the local repository for this site.  Commits were made frequently to ensure that code was never accidently lost, and the commits also acted as a fallback in the event that newly written code unintentionally broke older code.  Once the final pieces of code was pushed into the repository, the project was deployed by visiting the repository on GitHub and going to settings tab.  The master branch was selected as the source, and a link to the deployed project was provided. https://russellrothenbach.github.io/Second-Milestone-Project/
